Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved humble beginnings to power a large share of today's
digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built.

Java is easy to learn. Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile,debug, and learn than other programming languages. Java is object-or
iented which allows to create modular programs and reusable code. Java is platform-independent, one of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move 
easily from one computer systems is crucial to World Wide Web software, and Java succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary levels.


1. Write a Java program to print your name,  your address, your age.

MyIntro.java

import java.io.*;

public class MyIntro{
       public stastic void main (String[] args){
       System.out.println("My name is Prashun Basnet. I live in Balaju and i am 20 years old.")
2. Complete the following operation :
      - Addition 
      - Subtraction
      - Multiplication
      - Division

MiniCalc.java
import java.io*;

public class MiniCalc{
       public int add (int int a, int int b){
       return int a + int b;
       }
       public int subtract (int int a, int int b){
       return int a - int b;
       }
       public int multiply (int int a, int int b){
       return int a * int b;
       }
       public int divide (int int a, int int b){
       return int a / int b;
       }
       public static void main ( String [] str) {
       System.out.println ("MiniCalc"); 
       MiniCalc.mc=new MiniCalc();

       int int a = mc.add (1,2);
       int int b = mc.subtract (3,4);
       int int c = mc.multiply (5,6);
       int int d = mc.divide (7,8);
       
       System.out.println(int a)
       System.out.println(int b)
       System.out.println(int c)
       System.out.println(int d)
       }

       }
